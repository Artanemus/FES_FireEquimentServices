# FireEquimentServices
FES - Fire Equipment Services an ACCESS front-end with ADO MSSQL EXPRESS backend.
Ok so large .accdb files don't fit onto GitHub - my mistake.
The main front end module has been packed into a zip.

Future code for this site is ... 
1. Technicians remote inpection report (entered on site) (IP)
2. Some adminstration apps - written in C++ or pascal for Embarcadero RAD
