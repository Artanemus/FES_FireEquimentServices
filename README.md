# FireEquimentServices
FES - Fire Equipment Services an ACCESS front-end with ADO MSSQL EXPRESS backend.

Ok so large .accdb files don't fit onto GitHub - my mistake.
The main front end module has been packed into a zip.

Manage Customers, HR, HR-Staff, sites and stations, link customers to sites, create survey orders, create inspection orders. 

Manage equipment and there life cycle.  

Future code for this site is ... 
1. Technicians remote inpection report (entered on site) (IP)
2. Some adminstration apps - written in C++ or pascal for Embarcadero RAD.

ERStudio holds the database design for MSSQL EXPRESS dbo.FES database.
(SQL build scripts may appear in this folder.)

RemoteTech folder contains the application to input inspection order results (onsite).
